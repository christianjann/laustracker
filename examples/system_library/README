Test if linking the system wide liblaustracker library works.

compile:
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make

If the cmake command fails with the following error message then liblaustracker
is probably not installed:

  CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
  Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
  LAUSTRACKER_LIBRARY
      linked by target "system_library" in directory /home/...

  -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

Then just install liblaustracker:

  cd ../../
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install


To see which liblaustracker.so gets used run the following command:

  ldd build/system_library |grep laustracker

If the cmake command fails with the following error message then libueyecam
is probably not installed:

  CMake Error at cmake/FindUEyeCam.cmake:43 (message):
    could not find libueyecam.so
  Call Stack (most recent call first):
    CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package)
